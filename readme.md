# github-archive

This is an archive of old repositories that I no longer maintain. I wanted to make this so I could clean up my GitHub profile without losing the work I've done over the years. It's nice to be able to look back at old code to chart my personal progress. Plus, I might find that I need some of these things again some day.

The name of a directory is the repository's slug on GitHub.
